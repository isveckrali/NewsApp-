        "secondHead" : "So What does this new record for the lowest level of winter ice actually mean?",
        "secondDesc" : "The Arctic Ocean freezes every winter and much of the sea-ice then thaws every summer, and that process will continue whatever happens with climate change. Even if the ARctic continues to be one of the fastest-warming regions of the wirld, it will always be plunged into bittterly cold polar dark every winter. And year-by-year. for all konds of natural reasons. there's huge variety of the state of the ice."
